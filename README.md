# Bulk Renamer

Rename files based on a list you provide like a bunch of videos that you want to change all of them to a new list based on table of contents. Assume we have these files which are ordered but dont have a proper names associated with them:
<img src="./ordered.jpg"/>

And you have a text file `names.txt` which has their names in order:

```
luffy
zoro
sanji
sanji
```

This tool will give you these episodic names:

<img src="./ordered-named.jpg"/>

## Warning

- First test this app with some dummy files and if it worked for you then use on main files
- before start this app, make sure to have a backup
- this app will rename the original files

## How to Use

- First make sure to have a `names.txt` list provided with the same order as the files
- Download the latest version and put it beside the files then run it!

- Note: your `names.txt` must have new names based on the same naming order as your'e files are in the directory.
